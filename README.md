AIESEC Helsinki University's website version 1.0. [Link to website](http://goo.gl/5D9V7i)

AIESEC is the world's largest youth-run organization. As a leader of  AIESEC HY (Helsingin Yliopisto)'s Communication team, I plant marketing strategies especially for AIESEC recruitment and AIESEC HY's website. I made this website using Bootstrap 3, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.

Development notes
------
Below are some information about how the site was implemented:

+ color.html -> An image of a grey box which then will contain the definition of AIESEC, AIESEC Facebook like button, AIESEC Social Media (FB and Twitter button) and a MailChimp input for users to enter their emails to receive newsletter. All will be shown in index.html
+ gallery.html -> A place where memories of the organization were captured in photos. This page was built with the help of Polaroid Photobar Gallery's tutorial.

+ index.html -> See color.html
+ internships.html -> Information on how to apply for an AIESEC internship.
+ recruit.html -> Information on how to become a member of AIESEC HY
+ team.html -> Introduce about the current AIESEC HYers. This page was built upon the idea of Misfitwearables's team page. http://misfitwearables.com/team
